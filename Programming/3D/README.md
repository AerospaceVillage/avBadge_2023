# Jig for Programming the Badges

This folder contains extra pieces and parts that were designed to be added to this thingiverse [stable usb microscope stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2525155). The parts when printed allow for the [SparkFun ISP Pogo Adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11591) to be held in place by the stand and telescoped up and down the tower reliably making contact with the board being programmed. In the future we will probably explore different cable options to achieve this, but this is what we will make do with this year.

## Printing

The parts can all be printed without supports and were printed using a 15% infill.

Upon completion you will need 6 M2.5z8mm bolts with washers to affix the brackets firmly in place to the tower base. A kit with the correct screws can be purchased from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082XPZV1V).
