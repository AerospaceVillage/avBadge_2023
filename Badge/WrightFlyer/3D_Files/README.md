# Support Files

These files are are to support the additional parts that each badge uses. 

  - 3D printed motor housing
  - Laser cut propellers

## Motor Housing

The intent is that the motor is pressed into the 3D printed housing for a 
tight fit and then the housing itself is used to glue to the actual PCB. 
This allows for added rigidity to house the motor and a stabalizing 
surface area from which to glue. Heating the printed housing up (i.e. using a hot air station)
for a few moments to help soften the material prior to inserting the motor helps ensure no
binding is present. 


## Propellers

The Propellers were cut using the following tools/software:

  - 55w CO2 Laser 
  - Design - Inkscape
  - Laser Cutting File - Lightburn
