# Support Files

These files are are to support the 2 motors that each badge uses. The 
intent is that the motor is pressed into the 3D printed housing for a 
tight fit and then the housing itself is used to glue to the actual PCB. 
This allows for added rigidity to house the motor and a stabalizing 
surface area from which to glue.
