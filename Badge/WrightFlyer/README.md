# The Wright Flyer

First flown on December 17, 1903, this badge is a historical reference to 
those first 4 flights made that day nearly 120 years ago. The badge 
features 2 counter spinning propellers that the user can control. In 
addition the badge serves as a teaching aid for those interested in the 
intersection of Aviation and Cybersecurtiy. Explore the reversionary modes 
of motor operation and see what vulberabilites you can discover, but also 
importantly how you can mitigate the impact of those vulnerabilities 
through the redundant safety systems put in place.
