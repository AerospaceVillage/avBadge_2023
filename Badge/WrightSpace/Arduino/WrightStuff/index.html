  <h1>Aerospace Village</h1>
  <p>Celebrating 120 years of aviation and 5 years of the <a href="https://www.aerospacevillage.org/">Aerospace Village</a>!
    <br><br>
    The Wright Flyer made the first sustained flight by a manned heavier-than-air powered and controlled aircraft on December 17, 1903.
    Invented and flown by brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright, it marked the beginning of the pioneer era of aviation. Thier younger sister
    Katharine Wright Haskell worked closely with her brothers, managing their bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio, when they were away; acting as
    their right-hand woman and general factotum in Europe; assisting with their voluminous correspondence and business affairs; and providing
    a sounding board for their far-ranging ideas.
    <br><br>
    66 Years after that first flight Apollo 11 was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar
    module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person
    to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they
    spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin
    collected 47.5 pounds of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in
    lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia.
    <br><br>
    Incredible to think that the first flight made by the Wright brothers attained an altitude of just 10' and that only 66 years later we sent
    astronauts to the moon! What's more, a small piece of canvas from the original Wright Flyer was sent to Mars on the Martian
    Helicopter Ingenuity!
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;font-size:5px;">The Aerospace Village would not be where it is without the founding fathers of Pete
    and Spanky. We are thankful they briefly stopped telling "so there I was" stories that are less than 10% true in order to
    turn the idea of the Aerospace Village into reality. This text is black on black for a reason. We knew that highlighting text
    to reveal a message is about as much hacking as you can expect from some ex-fighter pilots. And even then we're pretty sure
    someone will have to point this out to them.</p>

  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>The artwork was inspired by the intersection of history and pop-culture, highlighting both the Wright brothers contribution to aviation and also the recent gains made by SpaceX and the exploration of space.
    Artwork was made possible by <a href="https://www.flysurreal.com/">FlySurreal Art Studio</a>. Check out a sample of his work <a href="wrightX.html">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Village Challenges</h2>
        <p>Any good badge has hidden things inside. You've been able to make it this far, how about we give you a clue for the next one:</p>
		    <p>In a badge with circuits concealed,<br>An alien's presence was revealed,<br>With a blink and a spark,<br>It glowed in the dark,<br>A tech secret, the pilots couldn't shield!</p>
        <p>Do you know who's image is depicted on the lanyard? If so, strike up a conversation with one of the Aerospace Village volunteers about it.</p>
      <h2>External Challenges</h2>
      <p>We're excited to work closely this year with some other villages and Def Con participants to present these following challenges.</p>
        <p>Hac-Man wants to know what the current altimeter reading for the Las Vegas airport is!</p>
